# Boxstarter can run any Chocolatey package. The only difference as far as the script is concerned is that your script also has access to Boxstarter's commands for configuring Windows, running updates as well as logging and reboot control.

# Update-ExecutionPolicy

# The execution policy is set in a separate elevated PowerShell process. If running in the Chocolatey runner, the current window cannot be used because its execution policy has been explicitly set.
